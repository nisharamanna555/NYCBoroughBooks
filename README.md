# Winning Project at NYU's Hackathon
This project was created for NYU's 2023 Hackathon, winning "Best NYC Hack". It utilizes MongoDB, JavaScript, and Firebase.

In the face of gentrification, the essence and culture of New York City is at risk. As four transplants, we felt compelled to address this serious issue. Introducing NYC BoroughBook â€“ an innovative web application that operates as a living historical document for New York City. Maintained by locals, open to all.
Local residents can create markers and give information about historical landmarks, locations that are special to them, or gems that make their neighborhood unique. We hope this will invite newcomers like us to partake in the culture of this city and become mindful residents.  
This application uses MongoDB to create and manage the database that tracks the different markers created by users. It utilizes Firebase for the authentication and authorization of users, ensuring only registered users can post on the website. Finally, the back and frontend of this website were built using JavaScript.
As gentrification continues to threaten the collective culture of New York City, NYC BoroughBook serves as an invitation to explore, engage, and contribute to the living narrative of this beautiful city.
